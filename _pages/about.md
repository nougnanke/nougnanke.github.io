I am an Assistant Professor in Networks and Cloud at [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/) (Institut Polytechnique de Paris).

My research lies at the intersection of networked systems and machine learning, with a focus on
(i) data-centric evaluation for ML-based intrusion detection systems,
(ii) performance isolation in multi-tenant cloud and data center networks,
and (iii) trustworthy automation for intent-based networking.

Before my current position, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Telecom SudParis, where I worked on
the SuperviZ project with [Gregory Blanc](https://cloudgravity.github.io/), focusing on dataset quality, diversity, and evaluation methodologies for machine-learning-based intrusion detection systems. 
I also held a JSPS postdoctoral fellowship at [IIJ Research Laboratory](https://www.iijlab.net/en/) (Tokyo, Japan) and was an associate member of the [JFLI](https://jfli.cnrs.fr/) (CNRS–Japan).

I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Université Paul Sabatier Toulouse III](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/) and LAAS–CNRS as a member of the [SARA](https://www.laas.fr/fr/equipes/sara/) research group,
under the supervision of Prof. [Yann Labit](https://www.laas.fr/fr/annuaire/109).
My doctoral research investigated the use of machine learning techniques for the management and
automation of computer networks, with contributions spanning SDN, self-driving networks,
network monitoring, and data center networks.
