I am a JSPS postdoctoral researcher at [IIJ Research Laboratory](https://www.iijlab.net/en/). My research interests include Cloud Computing, Data Center Networking, SDN, and Machine Learning.
I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Universit√© Paul Sabatier Toulouse III and LAAS-CNRS, under the supervision of Pr.
[Yann LABIT](https://www.laas.fr/public/annuaire?userid=399). My research work during the Ph.D. thesis aims to investigate the use of machine learning and AI techniques for the management of computer networks, which have to be highly automated within modern and future communication systems requirements. I then worked on SDN, Self-driving networks, Network Monitoring and Management, Data Centers, Machine Learning, and Bayesian Optimization.

For more details, see my [CV](../assets/pdf/CV_PhD_NOUGNANKE_pub.pdf).
